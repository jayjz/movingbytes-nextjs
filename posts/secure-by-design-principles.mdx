In modern application development, security cannot be a feature that is bolted on at the end of the lifecycle. It must be a foundational principle, woven into every stage from initial architecture to final deployment. This is the essence of the "Secure by Design" methodology.

## Threat Modeling: Thinking Like an Attacker

Before writing a single line of code, the first step is to perform threat modeling. This involves identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors. We ask questions like:

- Who are the potential adversaries?
- What are our most critical assets?
- How could an attacker compromise our data or services?

By answering these questions, we can build a proactive defense strategy.
